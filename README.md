Next, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to clone CampFinderCO's backend.

Then type: 

> git clone

Then paste the copied SSH key from GitHub by right clicking or pressing command + v (Mac users) or ctrl + v (Windows users).

Once the SSH key is pasted press enter.

Then type:

> ls

Find the file "camp-finder-backend"

Then navigate into the project directory typing:

> cd camp-finder-backend


Then type:

> code .

This will open up the project repository in VSCode.

Inside your terminal in VScode we'll want to start the server by typing:

> rails s

This will start our backend API.

Be sure to also check out https://github.com/andrrowens/phase-4-project-frontend for CampFinderCO's frontend repository.
