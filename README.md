# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Andrew and I'm a Software Engineer from Denver. I recently graduated from Flatiron School's Full Stack Software Engineering program and am open to new and exciting opportunities.

## Bio

Born and raised on the East Coast, the mountains were calling and I'm now lucky enough to call Colorado home. Prior to software development, my professional background is sales and strategy roles within the advertising industry. Working closely with adtech products and teams in my last role is what initially lit the spark that made me want to learn how to code. My passions include traditional Colorado pursuits such as snowboarding and backpacking, as well as sustainability and international travel.
